                <p>I'm John Behnke. I'm a student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute studying Computer Science. I'm passionate about programming, design, space, rocketry, 3D printing, and a ton more.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm currently a senior at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, New York. I'm enrolled as a Computer Science student aiming to get my B.S. in, you guessed it, Computer Science. Being a senior, I've taken a wide breadth of computer science classes ranging from your typical Data Structures and Algorithms classes to classes Distributed Systems and Algorithms and Parallel Computing. While I'm not working on assignments or studying for exams, I'm often hacking away on random projects, playing games, helping residents in my hall (I'm the Resident Director for a Residence Hall on campus), 3D printing, or working on my Level 2 Certification rocket.</p>

Could I have used some template off of a Google search for "simple personal website"? Probably, but then my site wouldn't be mine, so this is where we are.</aside>
